This is my repository where I will be keeping my lab information and changes to any BAE 305 lab. I think using GitHub is important when collaborating with others, especially during these labs where we work closely with our partner. This collaboration space makes it easy for partners to keep up with each other and make changes as needed to any repository spaces. Overall, I think it's important to learn GitHub and how to navigate it, as it is possible to use it as a collaboration space in the future with any other engineers or coworkers.
